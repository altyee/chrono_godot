# Project Chrono Binary for Godot 4 (mono)

This is a personal compilation of [Project Chrono](https://github.com/projectchrono/chrono) in the form of dll libraries. 

The c# files are generated by [swig](https://www.swig.org/), and a few function signatures are manually fixed. 

Note that Project Chrono only at the moment provide c# support for `chrono` (core) and `chrono_vehicle`. You can find additional documentation at https://api.projectchrono.org/. Be sure to also check [Project Chrono's license](https://github.com/projectchrono/chrono/blob/main/LICENSE).

It is mainly intended to work with [Godot 4](https://github.com/godotengine/godot), but should work with other c# based platforms.
